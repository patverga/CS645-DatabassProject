Changes for release 0.3
=======================
	Additions:
	----------
	- Support for all data types supported by WSML
	- A number of built-ins implemented
	- The evaluation modified to properly handle built-ins.
	- added the IMixedDatatypeRelation  and corresponding implementations
	- added the IndexingOnTheFlyRelation and corresponding implementations
	- Relational algebra operators modified to handle IMixedDatatypeRelation
	- Added the IRelationFactory interface (not all calls 
	  to the Relation constructor are exchanged, yet)
	- modified the IBuiltinInterface
	- reimplemented the Complementor class (used for the construction 
	  of the DOM)
	- modified the parser to distinguish the datatypes (according 
	  to the wsml datatype specification)
	- added the ITime interface, including the implementation, and so on...
	
	Fixes:
	------
	- added the possibility to make custom builitns (see doc folder for a
	  howto)
